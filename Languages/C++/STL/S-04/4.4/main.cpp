/**
 * Output iterators are similar to input iterators, except that they
 * perform only write operations.  Output iterators also process a
 * container only in a single pass and do no error checking. So the
 * code itself needs to check that a value to be written is valid and
 * whether each write operation was successful. Output iterators can
 * do the following:
 *
 * . constructor                 i(j);
 * . assignment operator         i=j;
 * . dereference operator        *j=t; *j++=t; // Can write, but can't read!
 * . pre/post increment operator ++j; j++;
 *
 * Many STL algorithms (e.g., copy() and transform()) return an output
 * iterator as their result, which enables chaining of these operations.
 *
 * The example below uses an input iterator to read ints from standard
 * input and store them into a vector using an output iterator
 * adapter.  It then uses another output iterator adapter to write the
 * contents of vector to standard out.
