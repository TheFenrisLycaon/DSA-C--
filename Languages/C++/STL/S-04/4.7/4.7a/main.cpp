/**
 * Random-access iterators allow the operations of pointer arithmetic:
 * addition of arbitrary offsets, subscripting, and subtraction of one
 * iterator from another to find a distance.  These are the most
 * powerful iterators and are like regular pointers but they are also
 * smart, e.g., they can hold state.
 *
 * In addition doing all that bidirectional iterators do, random
 * access iterators can do the following as well:
 * . operator+ (int) 
 * . operator+= (int) 
 * . operator- (int) 
 * . operator-= (int) 
 * . operator- (random access iterator) 
 * . operator[] (int) 
 * . operator < (random access iterator) 
 * . operator > (random access iterator) 
 * . operator >= (random access iterator) 
 * . operator <= (random access iterator) 
 *
 * This example demonstrates how the STL vector class provides a
 * random access iterator that can be used in a manner that's nearly
 * identical to pointer arithmetic on a C++ built-in array.
