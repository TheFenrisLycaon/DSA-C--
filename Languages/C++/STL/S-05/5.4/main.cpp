/**
 * Multisets are just like regular sets except that they allow duplicate keys. 
 *
 * template <typename Key, 
 *           typename Compare = less<Key>,
 *           typename Allocator = allocator <T> >
 * class multiset { ... };
 * 
 * Characteristics of multiset
 * . Stores objects of type key in a sorted manner.
 * . Its value type, as well as its key type, is 'key.'
 * . Two or more elements may be identical. 
 *
 * Set and multiset are particularly well suited to the set-related
 * algorithms: set_union(), set_intersection(), set_difference(), and
 * set_symmetric_difference() because:
 * 
 * . Set algorithms require their arguments to be sorted ranges and
 *   the elements in set and multiset are sorted in ascending order.
 * 
 * . The output range of these algorithms is always sorted and
 *   inserting a sorted range into a set or multiset is a fast
 *   operation.
 * 
 * . Inserting a new element into a multiset or set does not
 *   invalidate iterators that point to existing elements; only
 *   iterators pointing to elements being erased are invalid.
 *
 * The following example of multiset uses several STL algorithms. The
 * copy() algorithm copies each element from the specified range
 * (given by its first two input iterator arguments) into a location
 * pointed to by the third argument output iterator argument.
