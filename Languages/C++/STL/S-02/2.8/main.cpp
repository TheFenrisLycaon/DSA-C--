/**
 * Here are some problems with macros:
 *
 * . The C++ compiler does not verify that the macro parameters are of
 *   compatible types because macros don't do type checking.
 *
 * . In the macro version, the i and j parameters are evaluated twice, e.g.,
 * 
 *   int a = 10, b = 20;
 *   int c = min (a++, b++);
 *   int d = MIN(a++, b++); => (((a++) < (b++)) ? (a++) : (b++))
 * 
 * . Macros are expanded by the preprocessor, so, compiler error
 *   messages will refer to the expanded macro, rather than the macro
 *   definition itself. Also, the macro will show up in expanded form
 *   during debugging so programmers can't see its code during
 *   debugging, e.g., debuggers can't set breakpoints in macros.
 *
 * The function below demonstrates the problems with macros.
