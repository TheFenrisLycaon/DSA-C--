/**
 * When working with ordinary classes and functions, C++ programmers
 * place the class and function declarations into header (*.h)
 * files. Then the function implementation and any global variables
 * are defined in separate source (*.cpp) files that #include the
 * class header file. This approach allows the program to link
 * together the class declarations and definitions. Morever, any other
 * program using the class only #include's the class header files.
 * 
 * For template functions, however this method will not work because
 * when a program statement invokes the template function, C++ must be
 * able to instantiate the function based on the template or blueprint
 * of that function family. However, when the C++ compiler looks for a
 * definition in the header file it cannot find one (it’s in the
 * implementation source file).  Therefore, as the compiler processes
 * the implementation source file it doesn’t know what type of
 * datatype function will be instantiated later in the program file.
 *
 * When the compiler processes the program file, it compiler assumes
 * the template function will be defined elsewhere and leaves a
 * reference for the linker to locate where it resides. When the
 * linker comes along to process all the compiled object files
 * together into an executable file, it discovers the reference to
 * ‘find’ the function definition and it can't put the two files
 * (header and source) together to find it.
 * 
 * One way that programmers have solved this is to place all template
 * functions and their full implementation in the same file or to
 * #include the source file at the end of the header file.  This
 * method can increase the cost of using this template header file due
 * to its increased size and the size of any other header files, such
 * as <iostream>, that are often needed in function implementations.
 *
 * Note that non-inline functions create a new copy of the function
 * each time they are instantiated, rather than being expanded at the
 * site of the call.  Occasionally when creating large libraries of
 * functions, this can lead to two copies of the function in different
 * files, though "smart linkers" can eliminate this duplication.
 * 
 * This discussion applies to member template functions, and member
 * functions and data members of class templates. It's good practice
 * to place declarations and definitions in the same file or #include
 * the source file at the end of the header file.

 * Template functions and member functions are only instantiated when
