#   Bubblesort is an elementary sorting algorithm. The idea is to
#   imagine bubbling the smallest elements of a (vertical) array to the
#   top; then bubble the next smallest; then so on until the entire
#   array is sorted. Bubble sort is worse than both insertion sort and
#   selection sort. It moves elements as many times as insertion sort
#   (bad) and it takes as long as selection sort (bad). On the positive
#   side, bubble sort is easy to understand. Also there are highly
#   improved variants of bubble sort.

#   Best O(n^2); Average O(n^2); Worst O(n^2)
