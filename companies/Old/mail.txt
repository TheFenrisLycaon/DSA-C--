Hello Sir,

I was alloted the room 604 earlier which has now been changed to 356 in the same building upon start of my 3rd year.

Room 356 doesn't have an attached bathroom which is realy necessary for me due to my medical issues which was stated earlier as well.

Another reason for my request is because one of my friends, Mehul Tanak (19BCS4663), with whom I am really comfortable saring a room with.

Kindly reconsider my room allocation due to the reasons mentioned above.

Thanks,
Uidta Mitra
