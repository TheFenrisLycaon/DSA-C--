# Introduction

## Databases

Databases are a structure to store data in a tabular manner (relational database). Small sized databases are stored on the file system directly while larger databases are stored on the cloud. While designing a database, one should consider various factors like :

- Data Modelling
- Efficient Storage
- Query Language
- Security and Privacy
- Cocurrent Access and Fault tolerance

## DBMS

DBMS is defined as a way to organize, create and store data in databases. DBMS can be of many types related to their respective data models:

- Relational DBMS
- Object Oriented DBMS
- Object Relational DBMS
- Distributed DBMS
- etc

Examples of DBMS include :

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Oracle DBMS
- MS ACESS

The basic functionality of all the DBMS software remains the same : storage, retrival and updating DATA. The general expectations of a DBMS software are :

- Storage, retrival and updating data
- User accessible catalog describing the metadata
- Support for transactions and concurrency
- Facilities for recovering
- Support for authorization of access and update of data
- Access support from remote locations
- Enforcing constraints to ensure data in the database abides by certain rules
