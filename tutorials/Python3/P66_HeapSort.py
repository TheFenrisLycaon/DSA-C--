#  Approach:
#  Heap sort happens in two phases. In the first phase, the array
#  is transformed into a heap. A heap is a binary tree where
#  1) each node is greater than each of its children
#  2) the tree is perfectly balanced
#  3) all leaves are in the leftmost position available.
#  In phase two the heap is continuously reduced to a sorted array:
#  1) while the heap is not empty
#  - remove the top of the head into an array
#  - fix the heap.

#  Time Complexity of Solution:
#  Best O(nlog(n)); Average O(nlog(n)); Worst O(nlog(n)).
