/**
 * Functors work very much like function pointers, so we'll start by
 * reviewing how C++/C function pointers work. Function pointers are
 * pointers, i.e., variables, that point to the address of a function.
 * A running program gets only a certain amount of space in the main
 * memory. Both the executable compiled program code and the used
 * variables reside in this memory. A function in the program code
 * becomes nothing more than an address in memory.
 *
 * When calling a function, say f(), at a certain point called label
 * in a program, just put the call to the function f() at the point
 * label in the source code. Then compile the program and every time
 * the program execution reaches that point in the code, the function
 * is called.
 *
 * But what is efficient, if it is not known at compile time which
 * function should be called? Perhaps different objects will be
 * created in the program and this determines the proper function
 * call?
 * 
 * Determining the function to call at runtime might be done using
 * callback functions or selecting a functions out of a pool of
 * possible functions using a switch statement.
 *
 * Another way to achieve this functionality is to use the powerful
 * concept of a function pointer.
 *
 * Here is an example first using a switch statement and then doing
 * the same thing with a function pointer.  This is a function
 * designed to perform the four basic arithmetic operations as
 * function calls.
