/**
 * The class template istream_iterator reads elements from an input
 * stream using operator >>(). A value of type T is retrieved and
 * stored when the iterator is constructed and each time operator++()
 * is called.
 *
 * The iterator is equal to the end-of-stream iterator value if the
 * end-of-file is reached. The constructor with no arguments can be
 * used to create an end-of-stream iterator. The only valid use of
 * this iterator is to compare to other iterators when checking for
 * end of file. Do not attempt to dereference the end-of-stream
 * iterator; it plays the same role as the past-the-end iterator of
 * the end() function of containers.
 * 
 * Since an istream_iterator is an input iterator, one cannot assign
 * to the value returned by dereferencing the iterator. This also
 * means that istream_iterators can only be used for single pass
 * algorithms.
