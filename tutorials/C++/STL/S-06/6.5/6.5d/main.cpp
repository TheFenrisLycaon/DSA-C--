/**
 * A third type of stream iterator adaptor is the stream buffer
 * iterator, and there are two types, istreambuf_iterator for reading
 * and ostreambuf_iterator for writing streams.  These template class
 * objects can read or write individual characters from or to
 * basic_streambuf objects.
 *
 * The class template istreambuf_iterator reads successive characters
 * from the stream buffer for which it was constructed. operator*()
 * gives access to the current input character, if any, and
 * operator++() advances to the next input character. If the end of
 * stream is reached, the iterator becomes equal to the end of stream
 * iterator value, which is constructed by the default constructor,
 * istreambuf_iterator(). An istreambuf_iterator object can be used
 * only for one-pass-algorithms.
