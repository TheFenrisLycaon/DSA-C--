/**
 * The C++ standard library provides iterators for the standard
 * containers in STL (e.g., list, vector, and deque), and a few other
 * non-container classes, such as string.
 * 
 * The definition of iterators makes them much more than simple C/C++
 * pointers although they perform that type of behavior. They also
 * have a ‘state’, in other words they can hold data about
 * themselves. Their base classes are found in the header <iterator>.
 * 
 * An iterator gives a program access to the contents of a container
 * or other sequence of data, such as an I/O stream. One can think of
 * an iterator as an abstraction of a pointer; the syntax for using
 * iterators resembles that of pointers. 
 * 
 * An iterator points to a single element in a container or sequence
 * and can be advanced to the next element with the ++ (increment)
 * operator. The unary * (dereference) operator returns the element
 * that the iterator points to. Iterators, except for output
 * iterators, can be compared, and two iterators are equal if they
 * point to the same position in the same sequence, or if they both
 * point to one position past the end of the same sequence. 
 * 
 * There are also constant iterators defined for each container so
 * that a program can safely traverse a container without modifying
 * its elements. The STL algorithms that don’t modify container
 * elements (search, find etc) require const iterators as arguments. 
 *
 * Here's an example that shows how various types of vectors work with
 * their iterators:
 *
 * . Obtain an iterator to the first element in a container by calling
 *   that container's begin() member function.
 *
 * . Advance an iterator to the next element with the pre- or post-
 *   increment operator, as in ++it or it++ (it’s good practice to use
 *   ++it since this is more efficient).
 *
 * . Get the value the iterator refers to via the pointer dereference
 *   operator *, as in *it.

/** 
 * . Determine if an iterator is at the end of a range by comparing it
 *   to the iterator returned by the container's end member function,
 *   which returns an iterator that refers to one past the end of the
 *   elements. This is why the continuation test for the for loop in
 *   the example above is it != v.end().
